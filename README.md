## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### What I learned

- Advanced use of Array methods map and filter along with ES6 features like array destructuring
- Deeper understanding of context API and useContext for state management
- Leveraged ES6 features like destructuring optimally

### Continued development

I need to add few more features like replying to a reply and also make this a fullstack app in the next iteration
